## Overview

ðŸ‘‹ Hello, this is my first time using the MERN stack, because I always focused on the front-end using  React, but this project seemed to be perfect to practice with Express and MongoDB. 
I also decided to use Typescript with React for the frontend that added an extra level of difficulty since I am still practicing this helpful tool.

Overall, the project it's been very funny and interesting and let me with a lot of experience in many different tools.

Since I didn't use any external library to handle the few animations on the app, they are not so smooth and I am working on it! ðŸ˜„

Any feedback about the app it's more than welcome!

## My process

### Built with
- MongoDb
- Express
- React
- Node.js
- Typescript
- SCSS
- Hosted on Heroku
 

### Features

- I used Interface instead of Classes in several cases because The TypeScript compiler 
uses interfaces solely for type-checking purposes but neither provides implementation 
nor initialisation for them like classes.
Interface is simply a structural contract that defines what the properties of an 
object should have as a name and as a type. 


- It's possible to filter the invoices by status: "paid" , "pending" and "draft", the property
 "status" of the Invoice interface, infact can accept only these three values.

- Pressing the  'Esc' key or clicking outside a modal ,will close any open modal, I made this feature with useCallback and
useEffect

- I used a custom system to validate the "new Invoice form", with a simple validate function 
that iterate through all the input fields with a data-set of "required"(not the standard
 required attribute). The validate() return true if all the required input are filled.
